 A controller class specifically responsible for handling UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate functionality.
  
 In iOS 10 fewer responsibilities lie with the app delegate and a new delegate object is available for setup and managing notifications. This delegate object is responsible for handling the receipt of notifications. However for the purpose of this prototype I have also included notification authorization and registration.

         In iOS 9 and below, getting information about user settings around notifications were heavily limited. There was no way to tell the difference between a user with alerts, badges and sounds off and a user with notifications off. In iOS 10 there is now a way to retrieve information about everything around notification settings. Upon calling the api to get notification settings, the closure is run with a full list of settings including alerts, badges, sounds, lock screen, notification center and alert style. But also Authorization Status is passed back which will be one of the following:
 
         NotDetermined: indicates that the user has never been prompted to authorize the app to send notifications. this status is useful to figure out if a previous authorization has been done and if the user has seen an responded to the push permission prompt. 
         Authorized: indicates that at present the user has notifications turned on for the app regardless of the other individual settings. 
         Denied?: indicates that at present the user has notifications turned off for the app. 
 
         Here I am getting the notification settings before requesting authorization. This allows me to determine whether or not I have previously requested authorization and whether or not I should bother aetting up the rest of the notification stuff. If the authorization status is `NotDetermined` then I will know this is the first time I am requesting authorization and can log an analytic for the users' response.
