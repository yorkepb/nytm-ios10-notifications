/**
 This class is auto generated when a Notification Content Extension is created. It is necessary to configure the storyboard scene which will be loaded as the custom view for a given notification. When the extension is created it is done so with a `MainInterface.storyboard` as well as an `info.plist`. There are a few `info.plist` attributes that come preconfigured and some you must configure on your own to get this to work:

 Under they key: `NSExtension`:
 Under the Key: `NSExtensionAttributes`:
 `UNNotificationExtensionCategory`: Set this to the category used when sending the push notification
 `UNNotificationExtensionInitialContentSizeRatio`: Set this as a ratio of height to width of the initial View Controller
 `UNNotificationExtensionDefaultContentHidden`: Set this to true if you do not want the notification details (title, subtitle, body) appended to your view. Default is false if not configured.

 You must define a category for each extension you include in your app. You may have as many extensions as you would like and an extension may have multiple categories assigned to it, however each category may only be assigned to a single extension.
